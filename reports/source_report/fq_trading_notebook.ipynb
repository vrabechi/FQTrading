    "# Deep Learning for Financial Time Series\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to develop a deep learning model that predicts positive trends in Bitcoin prices. This project focuses on utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a type of recurrent neural network, to analyze and forecast time series data, aiming to accurately identify potential upward movements in the cryptocurrency market and provide insights into future price movements. The model is trained using historical Bitcoin data and evaluated through backtesting with a binary classification approach.\n",
    "#\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The financial markets, especially cryptocurrency markets, are known for their volatility and complex dynamics. Predicting the price movements of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin is a challenging task due to the high noise-to-signal ratio. Traditional statistical methods often fall short in capturing the nonlinear and temporal dependencies in such data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Literature Review\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Previous Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Various machine learning and deep learning techniques have been employed for stock and cryptocurrency price predictions, each offering unique strengths and weaknesses. This section provides an overview of these methods and highlights significant previous works.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Artificial Neural Network (ANN)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Artificial Neural Networks have been one of the earliest deep learning approaches used for financial market predictions. They consist of multiple layers of interconnected neurons that process input features to make predictions. ANNs can model complex nonlinear relationships, making them suitable for predicting market prices.\n",
    "- **Kimoto et al. (1990)** used a neural network to predict stock prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Their model incorporated technical indicators as input features and achieved notable predictive accuracy.\n",
    "- **Challenges**: ANNs often struggle with temporal dependencies in time series data, leading to the development of more specialized architectures like RNNs and LSTMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Support Vector Machine (SVM)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Support Vector Machines are a type of supervised learning algorithm that can be used for classification and regression tasks. SVMs work by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates data points of different classes with the maximum margin.\n",
    "- **Kim (2003)** applied SVMs to predict the direction of stock price movements based on technical indicators. The study demonstrated that SVMs could outperform traditional linear models.\n",
    "- **Challenges**: SVMs can be computationally expensive and may require significant tuning of hyperparameters. They also struggle with large and complex datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recurrent Neural Networks are designed to handle sequential data by maintaining a hidden state that captures information from previous time steps. RNNs can model temporal dependencies, making them suitable for time series forecasting.\n",
    "- **Chong et al. (2017)** used RNNs to predict stock prices and found that RNNs could effectively capture temporal patterns in financial data. Their study showed improved performance compared to traditional methods.\n",
    "- **Challenges**: RNNs suffer from vanishing and exploding gradient problems, which can hinder their ability to learn long-term dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Long Short-Term Memory networks are a specialized type of RNN designed to address the limitations of traditional RNNs. LSTMs use gating mechanisms to control the flow of information, allowing them to retain long-term dependencies and mitigate the vanishing gradient problem.\n",
    "- **Fischer and Krauss (2018)** employed LSTMs to predict stock returns based on historical price data. Their model outperformed benchmark models, demonstrating the effectiveness of LSTMs in financial time series forecasting.\n",
    "- **McNally et al. (2018)** applied LSTMs to predict Bitcoin prices. They compared LSTM performance with ARIMA and SVM models, concluding that LSTMs provided superior predictive accuracy for cryptocurrency prices.\n",
    "- **Advantages**: LSTMs are highly effective at capturing complex temporal patterns and long-term dependencies, making them well-suited for financial market predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Convolutional Neural Networks, typically used for image processing tasks, have also been adapted for time series forecasting. By treating time series data as one-dimensional images, CNNs can capture local patterns and trends.\n",
    "- **Borovykh et al. (2017)** explored the use of CNNs for financial time series forecasting. Their study showed that CNNs could capture local dependencies and provided competitive performance compared to RNNs.\n",
    "- **Challenges**: CNNs may not be as effective as LSTMs in capturing long-term dependencies but can be useful for identifying local patterns in data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hybrid Models\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hybrid models combine different machine learning techniques to leverage their individual strengths. For example, combining CNNs and LSTMs can capture both local and long-term dependencies in time series data.\n",
    "- **Wang et al. (2020)** developed a hybrid model combining CNNs and LSTMs for stock price prediction. Their approach achieved improved predictive performance by leveraging the strengths of both architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "LSTM networks have been widely used for financial time series prediction due to their capability to handle sequential data. Studies have demonstrated their effectiveness in predicting stock prices, index trends, and even cryptocurrency prices. The integration of LSTM with robust feature engineering techniques has shown significant improvements in prediction accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to predict whether the Bitcoin price will increase or decrease in the next time period based on historical data. The problem is framed as a binary classification task where the target variable indicates a price increase (1) or decrease (0).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks are capable of learning long-term dependencies in data sequences. They are particularly effective for applications such as time series prediction due to their structure, which allows them to remember information for long periods. This is critical in financial markets where past price actions can influence future trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Application to Bitcoin Price Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "For predicting Bitcoin prices, we utilize an LSTM in a `many-to-one` configuration, where multiple past data features are used to predict a binary outcome indicating whether the price will close up or down in the next time period. This binary classification approach aims to capture the inherently noisy and non-linear patterns of price movements in the cryptocurrency market.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, 8 years of daily Bitcoin data sourced from the Yahoo Finance API were used. The approach involves constructing and fine-tuning a stacked LSTM network, tailored to work with a sequence length of 15. This specific sequence length is chosen to capture relevant temporal patterns in the Bitcoin market, allowing for a more informed and accurate prediction of trend movements.\n"

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "The feature selection in this model leverages multiple methods, each adding a layer of sophistication to how features are selected and evaluated:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Boruta Algorithm**:\n",
    "   Boruta is an all-relevant feature selection method, particularly effective in distinguishing between relevant and irrelevant features by employing a statistical test. It operates by creating shadow features (random shuffles of real features) and iteratively compares the importance of actual features with these shadows as determined by a Random Forest classifier. The importance measure used is the Mean Decrease in Impurity (MDI) of the Random Forest, calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\text{Importance}(X_i) = \\sum_{t \\in T : v(s_t) = X_i} p(t) \\cdot \\Delta i(s_t, t)\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   Where:\n",
    "   - $X_i$ is a feature.\n",
    "   - $T$ represents all trees in the Random Forest.\n",
    "   - $s_t$ is the split involving $X_i$ in tree $t$.\n",
    "   - $p(t)$ is the proportion of samples reaching $s_t$.\n",
    "   - $\\Delta i(s_t, t)$ is the impurity decrease from the split $s_t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "   The iterative process continues until all features are classified as significant or not, with a max iteration parameter `max_iter` controlling the number of runs.\n",
    "#\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Correlation Analysis**:\n",
    "    To address multicollinearity, we perform correlation analysis among the features. Highly correlated features are identified, and one feature from each pair is removed. The Pearson correlation coefficient is used, calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$ \\rho_{X,Y} = \\frac{\\text{cov}(X,Y)}{\\sigma_X \\sigma_Y} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   Where:\n",
    "   - $\\text{cov}(X,Y)$ is the covariance of features $X$ and $Y$.\n",
    "   - $\\sigma_X$ and $\\sigma_Y$ are the standard deviations of $X$ and $Y$ respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    " #  \n",
    "3. **Mutual Information (MI)**:\n",
    "   MI is used as a filter method to evaluate the dependency of each feature on the target variable. Unlike linear correlation measures, Mutual Information quantifies the amount of information obtained about one variable through another, capturing both linear and nonlinear relationships. It is particularly valuable in complex datasets where linear correlations may not adequately describe the interactions between features and the target. The Mutual Information between two variables $X$ and $Y$ is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   MI(X;Y) = \\sum_{x \\in X, y \\in Y} p(x, y) \\log \\frac{p(x, y)}{p(x) p(y)}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "   Where:\n",
    "   - $p(x, y)$ is the joint probability distribution function of $X$ and $Y$.\n",
    "   - $p(x)$ and $p(y)$ are the marginal probability distribution functions of $X$ and $Y$ respectively.\n",
    "   #\n",
    "4. **K-Means Clustering**\n",
    "K-Means is employed for dimensionality reduction and to handle non-linearity by examining feature behavior across different clusters. The centroids found by K-Means can hint at natural groupings in data, which could potentially reveal patterns beneficial for prediction. The optimization goal of K-Means is to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS), represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{WCSS} = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\sum_{x \\in C_i} \\|x - \\mu_i\\|^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $C_i$ is the set of points in cluster $i$.\n",
    "- $\\mu_i$ is the centroid of cluster $i$.\n",
    "- $k$ is the number of clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining these methods, the selection process becomes more comprehensive, leading to a more refined and effective feature set for training the deep learning model.\n"

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "After selecting the best model architecture, **Optuna** is used for hyperparameter optimization, with **maximizing balanced accuracy** as the objective function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optuna** is a framework designed for efficient hyperparameter search. It employs various algorithms to explore the hyperparameter space, with the **Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE)** being the default and widely used method. TPE is a specific instance of **Bayesian optimization**, which focuses on finding the optimal hyperparameters by balancing exploration and exploitation during the search process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bayesian Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian optimization is a sequential method for optimizing expensive, black-box functions. The core idea is to construct a probabilistic model of the objective function, often referred to as a **surrogate model**, which predicts the performance of hyperparameters. Based on this model, new hyperparameter sets are selected that are expected to yield better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general process of Bayesian optimization involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Surrogate Model**: The objective function $f(x)$, where $x$ represents the hyperparameters, is approximated by a surrogate model. Gaussian Processes are often used for this, though **TPE** takes a different approach.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Acquisition Function**: The surrogate model is used to construct an acquisition function, such as Expected Improvement (EI), which helps select the next hyperparameters to test. The acquisition function typically balances exploration (testing new, uncertain regions) and exploitation (focusing on promising regions).\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\text{EI}(x) = \\mathbb{E}[\\max(0, f(x_{\\text{best}}) - f(x))]\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   where $f(x_{\\text{best}})$ is the best value observed so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Optimization**: The acquisition function is optimized to select the next set of hyperparameters that should be evaluated based on the surrogate model's predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE)\n",
    "\n",
    "In TPE, rather than modeling the objective function $f(x)$ directly, it models two probability densities:\n",
    "- **$l(x)$**: The probability density of hyperparameters associated with good objective function values (higher balanced accuracy).\n",
    "- **$g(x)$**: The probability density of hyperparameters associated with worse objective function values (lower balanced accuracy).\n",
    "\n",
    "TPE selects hyperparameters by maximizing the ratio of these two densities, effectively favoring regions of the hyperparameter space that are more likely to yield good results:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{l(x)}{g(x)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows TPE to efficiently explore the hyperparameter space by focusing on areas that are statistically more likely to improve the objective function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective function for this optimization is **balanced accuracy**, which gives equal importance to the true positive rate (sensitivity) and true negative rate (specificity). It is particularly useful for handling class imbalance. Balanced accuracy is calculated as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Balanced Accuracy} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{TP}{TP + FN} + \\frac{TN}{TN + FP} \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $TP$ is the number of true positives,\n",
    "- $FN$ is the number of false negatives,\n",
    "- $TN$ is the number of true negatives,\n",
    "- $FP$ is the number of false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "This metric ensures that both classes are treated fairly, which is especially important in imbalanced datasets, where standard accuracy might be misleading.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Optimization Process \n",
    "\n",
    "The optimization process follows these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sampling**: Optuna samples a set of hyperparameters $x$ from the predefined search space.\n",
    "2. **Evaluation**: The model is trained with these hyperparameters, and the validation balanced accuracy is calculated.\n",
    "3. **Update**: Based on the results of this trial, Optuna updates the distributions $l(x)$ and $g(x)$.\n",
    "4. **Selection**: Optuna selects the next set of hyperparameters to test, focusing on the most promising regions of the hyperparameter space by maximizing the ratio $\\frac{l(x)}{g(x)}$.\n",
    "5. **Iteration**: This process is repeated iteratively until the stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of trials or a time limit).\n",
    "\n",
    "This iterative process aims to explore the hyperparameter space and converge on an optimal set of hyperparameters that maximize the balanced accuracy of the model. The use of **TPE** allows for efficient navigation through the hyperparameter space, focusing on areas that are more likely to improve in subsequent iterations."

    "The comparison between the base and tuned models highlights a shift in performance focus after tuning. The tuned model achieved higher precision, which reduced the number of false positives and improved its ability to make more accurate positive predictions. However, this gain in precision came with a reduction in recall, meaning the tuned model missed more actual positive cases than the base model. As a result, the F1-score, which balances precision and recall, was lower for the tuned model. Although the overall accuracy and AUC remained relatively similar, the tuned model favored precision over recall, making it more conservative in predicting positive outcomes. This trade-off illustrates the model shift towards avoiding false positives at the expense of identifying all positive instances."

    "This project is divided into several key stages: data collection and pre-processing, feature engineering, and the development of a Bitcoin price prediction model using deep learning architectures. We gathered 8 years of Bitcoin market data from Yahoo Finance, ensuring that the dataset was properly structured and cleaned to meet the demands of time-series forecasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the feature engineering phase, a variety of technical indicators were incorporated, and advanced selection techniques such as Boruta, correlation analysis, mutual information, and K-means clustering were employed to refine the feature set. The use of the RobustScaler for data normalization helped mitigate the impact of outliers, which is critical for maintaining consistent model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple models, including LSTM, GRU, and hybrid architectures with convolutional layers, were evaluated for their effectiveness in capturing the temporal dependencies of Bitcoin prices. A 4-Layer LSTM model was chosen for its ability to retain long-term memory in sequential data, making them particularly suited to the volatile Bitcoin market. The model was further optimized using Optuna, which systematically explored the hyperparameter space to enhance performance, while TensorBoard enabled real-time monitoring and tracking during training and tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through backtesting, we validated the performance of the model against historical data, assessing its potential in a real-world trading environment. Despite the improvements made through feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning, the inherent volatility of the Bitcoin market presents significant challenges for maintaining predictive accuracy. Model performance was impacted by sharp price movements and periods of unpredictable behavior, which reflects the difficulty of forecasting in such a dynamic market.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, while the model demonstrated the ability to predict trends with reasonable accuracy, several practical limitations were acknowledged. These include the potential effects of trading costs, slippage, and the latency of real-time data processing, all of which can affect the model practical effectiveness. The complexity of LSTM models also led to longer training times and increased computational demands. The importance of managing the bias-variance tradeoff cannot be overstated, and further improvements are necessary to ensure the model generalizes effectively to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking ahead, there are several avenues for further development:\n",
    "- **Enhanced Feature Engineering**: Future work can explore advanced techniques such as genetic algorithms, sentiment analysis from social media, and blockchain-specific metrics to enrich the feature set.\n",
    "#\n",
    "- **Alternative Models**: Investigating other deep learning architectures, such as Transformers or Deep Reinforcement Learning, could provide improvements in capturing complex patterns.\n",
    "#\n",
    "- **Real-Time Adaptation**: Developing methods for real-time data processing and model adaptation can enhance the model responsiveness to market changes, improving its practical utility.\n",
    "#\n",
    "- **Advanced Hyperparameter Tuning**: Exploring more sophisticated hyperparameter optimization techniques and increasing the search space could further enhance model performance.\n",
    "#\n",
    "- **Robust Backtesting**: Continuous backtesting under various market conditions and stress-testing the model against historical market crashes or bull runs will provide deeper insights into its robustness and reliability.\n",
    "#\n",
    "- **Integration with Automated Trading Systems**: Implementing the model in a real-world automated trading system, with considerations for latency, execution speed, and integration with trading platforms.\n",
    "#\n",
    "- **Risk Management Strategies**: Incorporating advanced risk management techniques, such as dynamic position sizing and stop-loss mechanisms, can help mitigate potential losses and enhance the overall strategy performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while the model demonstrates potential in predicting Bitcoin price movements and informing trading strategies, continuous refinement and adaptation are crucial to maintaining its relevance and effectiveness in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency market. Ongoing research and development, combined with rigorous backtesting and real-world application, will be key to unlocking its full potential."
